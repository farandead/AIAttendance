AI-Based Attendance Software
This repository contains the code for an AI-based attendance tracking system that uses facial recognition for automated attendance. The backend is built using Django, while the deep learning model for facial recognition ensures accurate identification. The system stores and retrieves data using MySQL, with seamless integration via RESTful APIs.

Features
Automated Attendance Tracking: Utilizes a deep learning model for facial recognition to automatically mark attendance.
Real-Time Data Processing: Provides real-time attendance tracking with swift and accurate facial recognition.
RESTful APIs: Designed for smooth communication and data exchange between the frontend and backend.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive interface for educators to easily manage and track attendance.
Secure Data Storage: MySQL database used for efficient storage and retrieval of student attendance records.
Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Django
Deep Learning Model: TensorFlow/PyTorch (for facial recognition)
Database: MySQL
API: RESTful APIs
Facial Recognition Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition
